# Global Cities
An interactive database of the word's global cities. I built this as my final project at Spiced Academy, during the last week of the Javascript-focused web development course. Check out a live demo [here](https://global-cities.herokuapp.com/) and the rest of my web-development portfolio [here](https://github.com/aleesteele/portfolio).

## Technologies
- **Language**: Javascript
- **Frontend**: Handlebars, Three.js/Web GL
- **Backend**: Express
- **APIs**: World Weather Online, Google News
- **Data Management**: JSON

## Description
Using the [Google Chrome Experiment](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/chrome/globe) to plot data points, I combined my love of open data with a 3D rendering of the planet to create an interactive visualization (my first ever!).
